# VR Musical Journey - Jonathan Northtribe
A VR musical journey on a freeway through space set to the music of Jonathan Northtribe's song Routiful. Built in Unity and ran with Oculus Quest 1.

How to run:
1. Copy this project on your computer.
2. Open in Unity (built with version 2019.3.5f1 so it probably runs best with that)
3. Load scene MusicalJourney
4. Play via Oculus Link or build and run on your Oculus Quest

Alternatively you can try importing one of the apks to your headset and run it like that but I haven't tested it myself.

This was made possible by help and resources from other creators. Special thanks to:

- BRomans & their Exhibition of a Lifetime project (https://github.com/BRomans/EIT_Innovation_Entrepreneurship_Advanced)

- liu-if-else & their UnitySpectrumData example (https://github.com/liu-if-else/UnitySpectrumData)

- many other talented 3D artists on Unity Asset Store. 

Known bugs and issues:
- Exporting the project fails with the error Build path invalid. I haven't been able to solve it as of yet.
- Build and Run with Oculus Quest sometimes fails but the project still appears and works on the Oculus Quest headset anyway.
