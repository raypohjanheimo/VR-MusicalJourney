# VR Musical Journey - Jonathan Northtribe
A VR musical journey on a freeway through space set to the music of Jonathan Northtribe's song Routiful. Built in Unity and ran with Oculus Quest 1.

How to run:
1. Copy this project to your computer.
2. Open in Unity (built with version 2019.3.5f1 so it probably runs best with that)
3. Load scene MusicalJoruney
4. Play via Oculus Link or build and run on your Oculus Quest

Alternatively you can try importing one of the apks to your headset and run it like that but I haven't tested it myself.
