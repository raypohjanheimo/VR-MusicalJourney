# Exhibition of a Lifetime

An augmented piece of art for the class of I&E Advanced.
This VR art gallery aims to guide the user through a journey that covers the 4 main phases of human life: childhood, youth, adulthood and seniority.
The experience starts when the user interacts with the first orb that triggers the first art piece. 
Every new orb he/she encounters along the way is a trigger for a new art piece. 
We have chosen art pieces that represent for us the phases of life, and filled each room with a piece of classical music that express the feelings of that particular phase. The way that the artpiece represents a certain stage to us depends on the individual art piece. Our decisions were mostly driven by the colours of the pieces and the people/objects they included. Added to the art pieces themselves, the colours and lighting of the rooms were adjusted based on each stage, with the lights symbolising the stages of a day going from dawn until dusk. The objects in the room also help the audience to get into the spirit of the stage of life theyâ€™re currently seeing.
Between each phase there is an increment in the speed of the game, symbolizing how the perception of time changes through life. The light also reflects the sensations and the spaces get narrower while approaching the end of the gallery, giving an oppressing sensation of inevitable death.

The project has been developed using Unity and C# for Oculus Quest.
